LINEAR SEARCH

Assume that item is in an array in random order and we have to find an element. Then we begin with the first position and compare it to the number to be searched. If the element is at the same, we will return the position of the current element of the array . Otherwise, we will move to the next position. If we arrive at the last position of an array and still can not find the required element, we return -1.
